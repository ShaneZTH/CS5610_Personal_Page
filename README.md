### Project Objective:
1. I do not have a homepage before, so this project could fill the blank. It would be great to have my own homepage, introducing my experiences and interests. 
2. It provides an opportunity for me to practice frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript(Vanilla JS). Since I am mostly a backend person, this enrich and futher develop my technical skills.  I struggled a lot adjusting CSS selectors.

### Features of this webpage:
1. The main page has four parts: home, about, experience, and interest. These sections are listed on the navigation bar on the left side. Clicking the buttons will navigate you to respective location automatically.
2. The contact page is an independent page from the others.
3. A loader animation is added when first entering the page in case the components take too long to load. It would fade out after all components of the window is fully loaded.
4. A "scroll-to-top" button was placed at the bottom right corner. It was hidden at top. After you scroll down the page, it will fade in and show up. Clicking the button will smoothly scroll you back to the top of the page.
